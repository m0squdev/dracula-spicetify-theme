# Dracula theme for [Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/cli)

Fork of the [official Dracula theme](https://github.com/dracula/spicetify), which is outdated as of when I'm updating this file.

The color palette _mostly_ follows the [Dracula color scheme](https://draculatheme.com/contribute#color-palette).

The theme hides announcements and the filter chips on top of the homepage because they don't work with Spicetify (see [this issue](https://github.com/spicetify/cli/issues/3375) for reference).

## Installation

Follow the guide in [Spicetify docs](https://spicetify.app/docs/getting-started).
